# `IC-COSE`

‚öôÔ∏è A decentralized COnfiguration service with Signing and Encryption on the Internet Computer.

üíù Backed by a **$25k Developer Grant** from the [DFINITY Foundation](https://dfinity.org/grants).

## Overview

`IC COSE` is a fully open-source decentralized configuration service running on the Internet Computer. Based on the [CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE, RFC9052)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9052) standard, it offers centralized message signing and configuration data encryption. Configuration data is organized by namespaces and client subjects, supporting collaboration, fine-grained access control, and horizontal scalability. It can serve as a reliable and secure configuration center for various Web3 services and Web2 services with high data security and reliability requirements.

A imaginative use case is serving as a state persistence service for enclaves running in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), aiding in loading confidential data during startup and persisting confidential data states during runtime.

## Features

- Supports message signing and configuration data encryption (COSE, Threshold ECDSA, Threshold Schnorr, VetKeys).
- Organizes configuration data by namespaces and client subjects with fine-grained access control.
- Serve as a state persistence service for enclaves, aiding in loading and persisting confidential data during startup and runtime.
- Supports horizontal scalability, WASM module management, and Cycles recharge management.
- Can be used as a cluster management center for both Web3 and Web2 services.

## Who's using?

- [dMsg.net](https://dmsg.net): The world's 1st decentralized end-to-end encrypted messaging application fully running on the Internet Computer blockchain. dMsg.net uses `ic_cose_canister` to store encrypted keys for user.
- [IC-TEE](https://github.com/ldclabs/ic-tee): Make Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) work with the Internet Computer. IC-TEE uses `ic_cose_canister` to store configs and confidential data (TLS cert/key, root keys).
- [Anda](https://github.com/ldclabs/anda): An AI agent framework built with Rust, powered by ICP and TEEs. Anda uses `ic_cose_canister` to store agent configs, uses `ic_object_store_canister` to store AI memory states.
