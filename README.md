# `IC-COSE`

‚öôÔ∏è A decentralized COnfiguration service with Signing and Encryption on the Internet Computer.

üíù This project received a **$25k Developer Grant** from the [DFINITY Foundation](https://dfinity.org/grants).

## Overview

`ic-cose` is a fully open-source decentralized configuration service running on the Internet Computer. Based on the [CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE, RFC9052)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9052) standard, it offers centralized message signing and configuration data encryption. Configuration data is organized by namespaces and client subjects, supporting collaboration, fine-grained access control, and horizontal scalability. It can serve as a reliable and secure configuration center for various Web3 services and Web2 services with high data security and reliability requirements.

A imaginative use case is serving as a state persistence service for enclaves running in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), aiding in loading confidential data during startup and persisting confidential data states during runtime.
